title: Friendly UW Email Addresses
---
If you have a number in your University of Waterloo email address (e.g. `j9smith@uwaterloo.ca`), log in to [WatIAM](https://watiam.uwaterloo.ca/idm/user/), navigate to "Update Profile", switch to the "Email Configuration" tab, and check if you have a "Friendly email address" available to you. You may be able to claim the alias for your `firstname.lastname` (e.g. `john.smith@uwaterloo.ca`)!
